This repository introduces Partial Differential Equation Solver using neural network that can learn resolution-invariant solution operators on Navier-Stokes equation. Solving PDE is the core subject of numerical simulation and is widely used in science and engineering, from molecular dynamics to flight simulation, and even weather forecasting.

## Three Ways to Solve Partial Differential Equations with Neural Networks - A Review

**Abstract**: Neural networks are increasingly used to construct numerical solution methods for partial differential equations.
In this expository review, we introduce and contrast three important recent approaches attractive in their simplicity and their suitability for high-dimensional problems: physics-informed neural networks, methods based on the Feynman-Kac formula and the Deep BSDE solver.
The article is accompanied by a suite of expository software in the form of Jupyter notebooks in which each basic methodology is explained step by step, allowing for a quick assimilation and experimentation.
An extensive bibliography summarizes the state of the art.

We describe the PINN approach in the notebook [`PINN_Solver.ipynb`](https://github.com/janblechschmidt/PDEsByNNs/blob/main/PINN_Solver.ipynb) for approximating the solution of a **nonlinear evolution equation on a bounded domain** by a neural network.

In the notebook [`Feynman_Kac_Solver.ipynb`](https://github.com/janblechschmidt/PDEsByNNs/blob/main/Feynman_Kac_Solver.ipynb) we illustrate a PDE solver based on the *Feynman-Kac formula*.
We consider the solution by neural network methods of a class of partial differential equations which arise as the *backward Kolmogorov equation*, i.e., **linear parabolic second-order PDEs in non-divergence form on an unbounded domain in high spatial dimensions**.
The goal of the computations that are carried out in this notebook is to approximate the solution of the PDE at a fixed time where the spatial variable varies over some d-dimensional hypercube.

In this section we extend the methodology of the [Feynman-Kac solver (GitHub)](https://github.com/janblechschmidt/PDEsByNNs/blob/main/Feynman-Kac_Solver.ipynb) to solving *semilinear* PDEs where the reaction term contains lower order terms can depend in a general way on the independent variables as well as on the PDE solution and its gradient.

The implementation addresses the problem of evaluating the PDE solution at a fixed point in time and space.
However, the code can be modified to obtain the solution of the PDE at a fixed time in a domain of interest, as described in the [Feynman-Kac solver (GitHub)](https://github.com/janblechschmidt/PDEsByNNs/blob/main/Feynman-Kac_Solver.ipynb).
